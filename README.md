## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) 
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

This was my first time using Vite as a bundler for making React web apps, so I learned on how to configre and deploy Vite apps. I learned how to position items using 'transform: translatey()' in CSS, I used this to position the dice button in the center of the border on the advice container.  

### Continued development

I would like to continue to develop my CSS knowledge and skills which includes learning SASS for managing my CSS, responsive web layouts and making apps accessible.


### Useful resources

- [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) - I am currently working through part 3 of this fullstack course that focuses on using React as the frontend framework.
